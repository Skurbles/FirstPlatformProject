## Features

* Configurable setup:
    - Dynamic set of dices including d4, d6, d8, d10, d10x10, d12, d20
    - Easy dice customization (color, shapes, engraving, material...)
    - Configurable rolling box size and color

* 3 ways to roll:
    - Physics emulated rolling (slow but cool)
    - Turn to random generated values (faster but unrealistic)
    - Turn to given values (useful when the actual rolling is done remotely)

* Easy to integrate in your code:
    - Trigger rolling interactivelly o programmatically
    - A signal notifies after the rolling
    - Obtain results for individual dices or add up.

* Responsive to layouts:
    - The control adapts to the available space given by the layout
    - Whichever the resulting size, the camera adapts the zoom to fully see the rolling box floor
    - Automatically rotates the rolling box if the control aspect ratio is inverse to the one of the box
